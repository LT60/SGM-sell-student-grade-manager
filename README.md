# SGM-sell-student-grade-manager
A sell program to manag student achievement translation as the first practical training.[ch]

After finish the second pt(practical training), finally I take a morning to study how to use github to commit my codes.
But I still can't understand how it works.
That doesn't matter.
I used a very inefficient approach: first create a repository and then program in it.
But this method is not used for this repository and the next which will be named "SGM_DLG".
Because they have been completed (possibly).
These two repositories are uploaded by copying.
How brainless and inefficient
