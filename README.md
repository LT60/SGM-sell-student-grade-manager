# SGM-sell-student-grade-manager
A sell program to manage student achievement translation as the first practical training.[ch]

This program is a simple student performance management system running on the console.  The data structure is an array (array. h).  There are many places where the input content is not checked.  In addition, after learning the first chapter of data structure, I still want to construct a sequence table, but I haven't finished it, but the next training uses a doubly linked list, which is more advanced than the sequence table.

## To Do

Complete the data structure of the sequence table and complete all input data checks.

## Others

After finish the second pt(practical training), finally I take a morning to study how to use GitHub to commit my codes.
But I still can't understand how it works.
That doesn't matter.
I used a very inefficient approach: first create a repository and then program in it.
But this method is not used for this repository and the next which will be named "SGM_DLG".
Because they have been completed (possibly).
These two repositories are uploaded by copying.
How brainless and inefficient.
